# DND_Adventure
A DND-Esque choose your own adventure in C++.

This project is intended to familiarize myself with C++. I've previously coded in Java and MATLAB, so the principles have stuck with me. I really just need to get used to the syntax. Anyone is welcome to pull this code, it's not being used for anything significant.
